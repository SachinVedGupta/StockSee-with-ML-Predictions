## ABOUT STOCKSEE



## ABOUT PREDICTION MODEL

The yellow dots on the graph above represent predictions for the next 50 days of stock prices (into the future), made using a TensorFlow LSTM machine learning model. Each prediction is based on a batch of 200 previous daily stock prices, and the model forecasts the prices for the upcoming 50 days. A total of 1500 days of historical data is utilized in the training and validation process.

The model takes as input both the stock's daily closing prices and sentiment scores derived from public news articles. These sentiment scores are generated through a custom natural language processing (NLP) model, developed using TensorFlow and trained on a Kaggle dataset. The NLP model analyzes news articles related to the company, gathered via a news API, to assign a sentiment score for each day. By including not only the historical stock prices but also external factors like public sentiment and company news, the model is better equipped to predict future stock prices. Simply relying on past prices is insufficient, as factors such as company performance, innovation, and public perception play a critical role, making sentiment analysis an essential input for the prediction model.
